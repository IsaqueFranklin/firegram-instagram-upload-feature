Well, I'm not sure of which packages you'll need to install except for the firebase and the react-bootstrap.

- You can install firebase using "npm i firebase" or yarn.
- You can install react-bootstrap using "npm i react-bootstrap" or yarn.

If there is something missing just installed it on your terminal.
